# Automating PR Approval in Azure DevOps using python

<p>This sample is to provide an illustration of how we can use the platform SDKs provided by Azure Devops for python to develop a custom script which can be used to
   trigger automated pull request actions using the GITClient object. This object is basically as safe, resiliant way of invoking the Azure DevOps REST API. </p>
   
Requirements to run/debug this script:
  - Make sure your host machine has Python runtime - 2.x + versions
  - Any python IDE platform like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter or even Visual Studio 2017/2019 Community edition for that matter.
  - run this command to install the Azure Devops library : pip install azure-devops
